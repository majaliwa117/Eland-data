Data used for this thesis analysis:

This repository contains both R scripts and data files used for analysis.

Data consists of resource abundance, abiotic factors, predation metrics and anthropogenic disturbance metrics. 

Resource abundance- Density of forbs, Vegetation biomass,distance to river, Dung heap, habitat type and Tree/shrub density.

Abiotic factors-NDVI, dNDVI, Rainfall, Elevation, slope, topographic wetness index and landscape curvature

Predation risk- Cover for lions(%), Escape impediments, distance to drainage bed, distance to river confluence

Anthropogenic disturbance-Tourism footprint, distance to road, distance to park rangerpost, Human proximity and distance to park boundary

These data were used for a traditional resource selection function and integrated step-selection analysis.

R Script: 

1. RSF.R - Traditional resource selection function was used to answer one question:
 i) Do eland preferentially select areas with high resources abundance or do they select areas free from natural predation across seasons?

2. ISSA.R -Integrated step selection analysis was used to address two questions:
 i) How do resource abundance, predation risk and anthropogenic disturbance influence where eland select to move ? 
 ii) Does eland move faster or slower if they start in anthropogenic or predation risk area?  


Data Files:

1. RSF_data.csv
- Column consists of a animal_id, date and dist_variables
- All variables starting with dist_ are euclidian distance in kilometers

2. Issf_data.csv
- Column consists of a animal_id, step_id,case_, tod_end, start_ and end_
- All variables starting with start_ were extracted or calculated at the start point(beggining coordinates)
- All variables starting with end_ were extracted or calculated at the terminal coordinates(end point)
